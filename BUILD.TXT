Requirements
============

- GCC and GNU toolchain
- GRUB2 (if creating image from scratch)
- Autoconf 2.64
- debugfs
- QEMU (qemu-system-i386)

Build
=====

First we need to build a gcc cross-compiler. A script is
provided for this. It needs to download the compiler 
sources so you must be connected to the internet when you
run it:

tools/gcc/make_gcc.sh


Now you can just run make on the top-level project directory
to build a QEMU hard disk image. Then run 'make run' to boot the
image with QEMU.
